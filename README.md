# Machine-Failure-Prediction
Predictive maintanence (PdM) is the maintanence of machines at a predicted future time before the machine failure. This allows scheduled maintanence of the machines, reducing the unplanned downtime costs.  This repository contains deployable end-to-end classifiers to predict the probability whether a machine failure will occur or not.
